                                                    I don't know of any child who, early on, is clear about what kind of life partner they want when they grow up. But Shubhanshi, who I call Shu, was a different case. From childhood, she had her 'Mr. Perfect' clearly in mind whom she named 'RAHUL BAJAJ'. And in pursuing her 'RAHUL BAJAJ' she rejected so many prospects and proposals, breaking many hearts. 

                                                    <br><BR>
                                                    Shu's parents, who were also trying to find Shu's 'Rahul Bajaj', were tired and at their wit's end. But not ready to give up, they told her about this boy they'd really liked and asked her to speak to him, promising in return that they would halt their search for 3 months. 
                                                    <br><BR>

                                                    Phone numbers were exchanged. The two started messaging. The messages turned into calls that kept growing longer and longer in duration, turning into long chats. When I asked her then, "Is he your 'RAHUL BAJAJ?", she responded, for the first time in so many years of searching, "Maybe." 
                                                    <br><BR>

                                                    This is where they started to come together. Shu, a girl who would never wake up early, started waking up at 6.30am so that she could speak with him. And anytime she wasn't talking to him, she kept talking about him! Shu had never thought 'arranged' marriage' is how she would meet her lifemate but Darpan, the boy, swept her off her feet and she didn't even realize when love blossomed. 
                                                    <br><BR>
                                                    Finally, they decided they would meet and Shu flew to Seattle, where Darpan lives. At the airport, Darpan welcomed her warmly and then treated her to a homemade lunch of all her favorite dishes (that he had cooked himself). For the next 3 days, they spent time with each other, roamed around Seattle, and fell even deeper in love. 
                                                    <br><Br>
                                                    On the 4th day, as Shu and Darpan sailed on a yacht in the middle of beautiful Lake Washington, he went down on one knee and asked her, "Will You Marry Me?!" And Shu could say nothing other than "YES!!" to the man who had turned out to be her 'Rahul Bajaj', the man of her dreams, "Darpan Soni."

                                                                    Darpan was a very naughty kid, even when he was just two. He would throw things out from the balcony, put lizards and rats into the water tank and scare the girls in the building. His mischief was widely feared and I would wonder, what will happen in the future. But as he grew up, the naughty exterior gave way to his loving and sensitive soul. And that is the person Darpan is today. 

                                                                    <br><BR>
                                                                    He made a life for himself in the US, with a great career, friends who feel like family and a variety of interests. But he needed to find a life partner to share it all with, his family insisted. As Darpan started the hunt for his soul mate, he was introduced to Shubhanshi, and they hit it off immediately, right in their first conversation. But Darpan feared that marriage would require compromises and would change his 'bachelor' life completely. He wasn't sure if he was ready for that step. 
                                                                    <br><BR>
                                                                    Such was the intensity of his liking for Shubhanshi, that he moved past his fear and continued to call her, talk to her. With every chat, every call, he grew fonder. He realised that with an understanding and fun partner like Shubanshi, marriage wouldn't change his life, it would only be the start of something wonderful. Shubhanshi was the one. 

                                                                    <br><BR>
                                                                    She, in turn, had a magical transformative effect on Darpan. Where once he spent his weekends lazying at home, he now became active, making plans for when she would visit Seattle. Soon enough, Shubhanshi landed in Seattle for their first meeting and Darpan planned it all to make her feel like his princess—Flowers at the airport, gifts at the car, and a homemade lunch of her favorites (that he woke up early in the morning to prepare). The whole week of her visit was full of sight-seeing and spending time with each other. On her birthday, he surprised her with a flight over Seattle in a seaplane and a 'surprise' party with his friends.
                                                                    It all culminated, with the moment he went down on one knee and proposed to Shubhanshi on a yacht in the middle of Lake Washington. Where once this boy had tormented girls with his mischief, he has now grown to be a charmer and nothing less than a romantic hero! Shubhanshi is the girl of his dreams and she had no choice but to say "YES!"

I remember telling her that "if you have to become something in life, you'll have to work hard towards it and take your decision independently." She took that to heart and has been very independent with her decisions. Even with the guy, she was very picky,which used to bother us. But she, keeping us also in consideration, decided to be with darpan and we are really proud of the decision both of them made. As parents, our happiness lies in our children and they made us really happy being with each other. All the best to the couple.

Shubhanshi always wanted to go to US, at least for a few years and her strong determination made her meet Darpan fighting against the odds. She took her time to decide but Darpan is absolutely worth the wait. Even his family is great and they treat Aashu like their daughter. I would just say, I am lucky to have both my son-in-laws, rather my sons 🙂

                                                                I have never seen anyone make her so happy and excited which i must say is a task in itself. So, CONGRATULATIONS Darpan.
                                                                I welcome you to the clan.

When didi started talking to jiju, I got really excited since I saw didi so sure for the first guy. Even when jiju talks to me, it feels that I have known jiju for a very long time. I am very happy for both of them. Love you didi jiju ❤
